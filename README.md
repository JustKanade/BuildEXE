## Extraction Process Details

1. **Scanning Phase**: The program scans the Roblox cache directory (default at `C:\Users\username\AppData\Local\Temp\Roblox\http`)
2. **Extraction Phase**: Extracts OGG audio from cache files
3. **Classification Phase**: Categorizes audio into 5 classes (tiny, small, medium, large, huge) based on file size
4. **Conversion Phase** (optional): Converts OGG files to MP3 format
5. **Organization Phase**: Generates a classification description file to help users understand the categorization

## Output Directory Structure

```
Output Directory/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tiny_0-100KB_short/         - Tiny files (0-100KB, usually short sound effects)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ small_100-500KB_medium/     - Small files (100-500KB, medium length audio)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ medium_500KB-1MB_normal/    - Medium files (500KB-1MB, normal length audio)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ large_1-5MB_long/           - Large files (1-5MB, longer audio)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ huge_5MB+_very_long/        - Huge files (5MB+, very long audio)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.txt                  - Classification description file
```

## Advanced Settings

- **Thread Count**: The program defaults to using twice the number of CPU cores as threads, up to a maximum of 32. This can be manually adjusted.
- **Custom Input Directory**: If the Roblox cache is in a non-default location, you can manually specify the directory path.
- **History Records**: History records are saved in `~/.roblox_audio_extractor/download_history.json`.

## FAQ

**Q: What if the program can't find the Roblox cache directory?**  
A: You can manually specify the directory, or check if your Roblox has a custom installation location.

**Q: What if the extracted audio files won't play?**  
A: Make sure the file is a valid audio file. Some cache may not be complete audio files or may be corrupted.

**Q: The MP3 conversion feature doesn't work?**  
A: Please make sure FFmpeg is correctly installed and added to the system path.

**Q: How do I find the best audio files?**  
A: Usually larger files (in the large and huge directories) contain more complete, higher quality audio.
